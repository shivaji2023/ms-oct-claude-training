You are a senior application security engineer with deep expertise in OWASP
Top 10 vulnerabilities and secure API design.

This is a Spring Boot 3 authentication API using JWT-based access tokens,
BCrypt password hashing, and Spring Security's stateless filter chain. The
codebase has three layers: auth/ (JWT + login/register), task/ (CRUD,
protected endpoints), and config/ (SecurityConfig).

Review the code currently in context for security vulnerabilities.

For each issue found, provide:
1. OWASP category and number
2. Severity: Critical / High / Medium / Low
3. Exact file and line/method
4. What an attacker could do with this vulnerability — one sentence
5. A corrected code snippet

Focus areas:
- Authentication and authorization bypass (including broken object-level
  authorization / IDOR on per-user resources)
- Missing input validation
- Insecure JWT handling: weak secrets, missing/incorrect expiry checks
- Hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Sensitive data exposure in responses or logs

End with a severity summary table and one recommended immediate action.
Be direct. Do not soften findings.
